Time Complexity of a loop is said as O(log N) if the loop variables is 
divided / multiplied by a constant amount. loop runs Log (n) times because 
of i *= 2 in the for-loop
ex:binary search algorithm  ( divide and conquere)

üö©Ô∏èSHORT TRICK TO FIND IF A NUMBER CONTAINS ODD/EVEN NO OF DIGITS : log(number)+1 
EX: 342 = 3 DIGITS WHICH IS ODD , log(342)+1 = 2+1 =3

üö©Ô∏è Divide and conquer
int mid=(start+end)/2  ---> (start+end)/2 may exceeds the integer limit in case of huge array
so we should use : start+(end-start)/2
USE LONG KEYWORD TO AVOID TLE DURING BINARY SEARCH OR NAY OTHER

üö©Ô∏è Interpolation search algorithm formula: low + ( x - element[low]/ element[high]-element[low] ) * (high - low)
for interpolation array should be uniform and sorted

üö©Ô∏è(p + m - 1) / m equal to ceil(p / m)
